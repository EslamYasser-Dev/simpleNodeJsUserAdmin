Configuration
MongoDB Connection
The MongoDB connection string is handled using the MONGO_URI environment variable. You can set it in various ways:

Command Line:

bash
Copy code
export MONGO_URI='your_actual_connection_string'
Environment Variable Files:

Create a file named .env in the root of your project and add:

dotenv
Copy code
MONGO_URI=your_actual_connection_string
Make sure to add .env to your .gitignore file to avoid committing sensitive information.

Using a Package like dotenv:

Install the dotenv package:

bash
Copy code
npm install dotenv
Create a file named .env and add:

dotenv
Copy code
MONGO_URI=your_actual_connection_string
In your main script (usually where you start your server), add:

javascript
Copy code
require('dotenv').config();
Mongoose Configuration (Optional)
Mongoose has additional configuration options that you can set in the mongoose.connect call. Refer to the Mongoose Documentation for more details.

Usage
To run the project, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the server, and you should see the message "Connected to serverless MongoDB" in the console.
